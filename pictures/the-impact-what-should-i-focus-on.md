alt: A painting of Christian Taylor positioned to the right of frame and gazing straight to the left. There is a golden hand reaching toward Christian and an word bubble eminating from Christian's mounth containing iconography of a hand being severed by a shard object. Above Christian's head there is a red archer drawing his bow and a red dashed line connecting the end of the bow's arrow and the head of a cherub. The cherub is covering it's mounth in the act of wispering into Christian's ear.
