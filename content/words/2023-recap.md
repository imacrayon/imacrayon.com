description: My 2023 end of year recap
---

* Moonbase Labs stuck around for another year, work was steady.
* This was my first year in a while that I've only worked for a single organization. Last year Friendship Lamps by Filimin sold to new owners and it felt like a good time to sunset my work on that project.
* I built an [electric vehicle fleet management tool](https://fleet.lightningemotors.com) for [Lightning eMotors](https://lightningemotors.com), we've already seen a few competitors in the industry copy the same look and feel.
* I mostly stayed off social media again except Twitter, I'm probably too addicted to Twitter right now.
* I wrote 3 blog posts. That's better than last year, but still bad.
* I started talking about [Alpine AJAX](https://github.com/imacrayon/alpine-ajax); I even designed and built a [documentation site for it](https://alpine-ajax.js.org). The repository now has [about 160 stars](https://github.com/imacrayon/alpine-ajax/stargazers) and it's [getting some recognition on Twitter](https://x.com/htmx_org/status/1737856532770074986) and in the Django community.
* I maintained a vegetarian diet.
* I worked out regularly all year and gained another 10 pounds.
* I attended [PHP\[tek\]](https://tek.phparch.com/) in Chicago, IL; my very first tech conference.
* I visited Nashville, TN for the first time while attending [Laracon US](https://laracon.us/); also my first Laracon.
* I met some of my web development heros.
* I listened to a lot of [Ratboys](https://last.fm/music/ratboy) and [The Weakerthans](https://last.fm/music/the+weakerthans).
* I discovered music by [Imani Graham](https://last.fm/music/imani+graham), [Jungle](https://last.fm/music/jungle), [Petey](https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/petey), [Sampha](https://last.fm/music/sampha), and [Samia](https://last.fm/music/samia).
* I saw [Jeff Rosenstock](https://last.fm/jeff-rosenstock) live for the first time in Tulsa, OK.
* I proposed to Carmen in the Flint Hills on Christmas Eve Eve.
